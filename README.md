**Tech Stack:** Python · LangChain · Ollama · Streamlit

### Vibe Check (private repo)
_Team project (4)_  **Role:** Project manager and technical contributor — led evaluation design, coordinated team communication, and supported UI development.

Developed a two-tier sentiment analysis pipeline (VADER + Google Cloud NLP) and a personalized venue recommendation engine with interactive “vibe weight” sliders and a map-based UI, achieving 78% Precision@3 in vibe tagging and 62% sentiment classification accuracy on the Yelp Open Dataset.

**My contributions:**  
- Stepped up as project manager, leading team communication, facilitating meetings, documenting action items, and tracking progress throughout the project
- Took primary responsibility for drafting and assembling the final report and presentation, integrating technical findings with product and design highlights
- Developed the interactive map UI for the front page (using Leaflet), including toggle functionality between map and list views  
- Developed the evaluation framework: independently set up the golden dataset labeling process, established the project’s performance metrics (precision@3, tagging accuracy), and document findings 

*Note: This was a collaborative, end-to-end product design and ML project. Repository is private due to course policy
