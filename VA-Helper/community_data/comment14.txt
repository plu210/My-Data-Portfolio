Yeah, the VA does consider your MOS and deployment missions into consideration , depending on what the claim is. Usually these are referred to as "presumptive" lists, and it basically means that they "presume" that the condition is related to your service if your MOS or deployments are on that list. This gives you a lower (not zero) hoop to jump through to qualify for whatever claim you're making. For example, if you spent 20 years in artillery, you're probably on the presumptive list for tinnitus. Desert Storm vets that served in country are starting (I think?) to be on a presumptive list for exposure to toxic fumes under the PACT act. Like that.

Anyway, you'll have to look into that list for your claimed ailments (not all, or even most, conditions have one, but most of the heavy hitters do.)

The best thing you can do is make damn sure your record reflects every place you've been and every thing you've done.
