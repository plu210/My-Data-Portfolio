Never needed VA healthcare until I lost my job in 2016.

Filed claim for tinnitus in 2021, had quick, easy C&P exam. Claim approved late in 2021. The more I'm learning about this process the more I've come to understand that a C&P examiner and the raters' opinions, bias, mood and whatever else plays just as much into a decision as any of the facts and circumstances of a claim. There is no past practice, precedents are non-existing, and decisions are ALL over the board as a result. It's one hellova mess.
