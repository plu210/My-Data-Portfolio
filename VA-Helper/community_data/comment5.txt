I was in a similar tinnitus situation when I was putting my claim together. I had no service connected medical records reporting tinnitus but plenty of noise exposure. However I included a buddy letter from a fellow vet who served with me which stated "I remember him complaining of ringing after a flash bang, controlled DET, flightline operations, etc.". Plus my civilian doctor made a note stating the he believed that my tinnitus was military connected. I also included medical references showing tinnitus can occur years after noise exposure. I got my 10% .
