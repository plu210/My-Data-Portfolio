I was asked if I had ringing in my ears by the medical people. No I never had ringing.

I had buzzing. I thought it was electrical power lines. I lived near them as a kid and it sounds like that to me.

Flash forward to 7-8 years post service and I was asking if anyone could hear "those power lines." They all thought I was crazy until someone recognized what was happening and described tinnitus to me. Light bulb moment.

Well I told VA about that and they accepted my tinitus claim.

Probably helps that I've been damaged by multiple IEDS and was artillery.
