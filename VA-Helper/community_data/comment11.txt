I got service connected for Tinnitus, 24 years after service, no in service Complaints and hearing was good.

Go to your hearing test and do the last follow up with the ENT. You will then have your Diagnosis hopefully of Chronic and Recurrent Tinnitus.

Make sure your notes reflect what you plan to tell the C-P Examiner make sure when asked it started between May and June of 1990 something or whenever. a time frame if possible tie it to a deployment so you can get the specific dates ranges

Here is what I think the Examiner wants to hear from you.

You have a narrowed down date in service of when it started

Where were you when you noticed it?

Details of the Length, time of exposure, How close you were to said MOS exposure all noise exposure,

Most importantly Your physical reaction to said noise did you twitch, Did you cover your ears, Did you seek a quiet place from that noise. Did your teeth rattle Did you have to take a break from the noise

If you were in a loud space did you have to yell to communicate did you have to remove your ear pro to communicate weave a story.

If you were at the range how often did you go, how many rounds did you fire, How many people would be around you with weapons when you were there firing if you were a motor pool guy be specific on the noise what was the equipment you worked, How close in feet were you to said noise, How long were you around said noise. How many equipment were operating around you

Paint the picture

Also if you currently own a Motorcycle, shoot guns work in a noisy environment the examiner does not need to be Privileged of all ur info so learn to say No. You don’t listen to music you don’t do anything that has a high noise content today if you answer or volunteer info your ass will be denied
