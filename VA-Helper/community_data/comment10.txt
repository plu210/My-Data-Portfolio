Tinnitus is the easiest thing to get SCâ€™d for and its not even close. There is no test for tinnitus, so no one, not even a medical professional, can say you don't have it. To get a grant you need to state that ringing in your ears began during service and has continued to the present. Be sure to connect it to some specific instance of noise exposure in service.
