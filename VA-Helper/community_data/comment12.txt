I was recently denied for tinnitus. My MOS is listed as "highly probable", but still denied. My civilian doctor determined there are signs of damage and during my C&P exam a hearing test was conducted, which confirmed tinnitus. BUT, there was/is no one event in the my service record that points to hearing damage.

Here is what the VA had so say in my denial letter. Seems pretty fair...

In accordance with 38 CFR 3.159 (c)(4)(A), (B) and (C) to establish service connection, the evidence must show three things: An injury in military service or a disease that began in or was made worse during military service, or an event in service causing injury or disease, a current physical or mental disability, and a relationship between a current disability and an injury disease or event in military service. (38 CFR 3.303, 38 CFR 3.304, 38 CFR 3.103(f), 38 CFR 3.159)

VA examination dated July, shows a diagnosis of recurrent tinnitus. The examiner opined that your tinnitus is less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) caused by or a result of military noise exposure. The examiner provided the following rationale: the date of onset of tinnitus is 2018, the circumstance of onset of tinnitus is: claimant first realized ringing in the ears in 2018, first went to a doctor in 2021; there was no special incident in 2018, Claimant hears a mix in between an ocean and a ringing to it, intermittently high-pitched, sometimes he can only hear the ocean sound. The tinnitus was noticed gradually; there was no single precipitating event. Given the onset of the symptoms, which were many years post discharge, and the intermittent nature of the tinnitus, it is less likely than not the result of military noise exposure.

Good luck!
