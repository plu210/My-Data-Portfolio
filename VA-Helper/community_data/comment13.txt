Yes, the VA does take your MOS or deployment missions into consideration, a perfect example is tinnitus. If you have ringing in your ears along with being a combat arms job itâ€™s usually not even questioned because they already know we are all going deaf.
However, I still made it a point to provide that list that shows my AFSC is on the "highly probable" side for tinnitus. I'm not going to assume that they can put two and two together just based on what I did.
